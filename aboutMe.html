          <p>
            I am in the process of completing my Data Analyst certification with Google and
            working on Cybersecurity CompTIA Security+. I am learning fundamental data analytics
            skills such as data cleaning, SQL, R programming, and Tableau, along with cybersecurity
            skills including IT knowledge, security fundamentals, tools, and compliance.

            As an experienced Amazon problem solver, I mitigate risks through teamwork, communication,
            and a basic understanding of the Amazon FC process. Before taking on my current role,
            I worked as a tax expert at H&R Block, where I refined my attention to detail and upheld
            rigorous compliance with tax laws. During this time, I also developed the skill of prioritizing
            client scheduling based on the complexity of their tax needs. Additionally, I completed a rigorous
            software developer boot camp with WeCanCodeIT, where I gained proficiency in front-end, back-end, and
            software development best practices. I am certified in programming languages Java, JavaScript, SQL,
            HTML, and CSS, as well as in the fundamentals of Object-oriented Programming, Unit testing, Agile
            methodologies, and API development.
