          <p> I am a data professional passionate about how AI and data analytics drive real-world business success. 
            As a Data Analyst Apprentice at Verizon (2024-2025), I was embedded with a team of AI Product Managers, 
            learning how data is incorporated into business strategy from the ground up. I was responsible for monitoring 
            the growth of an AI product designed to help our front-line workers sell more efficiently. This role provided 
            a powerful lesson in practical application, as I conducted field visits and interviewed store reps to see firsthand 
            how product decisions worked in the real world, not just on paper. My key project involved using LookerML and Google 
            Cloud Platform (GCP) to build a live dashboard monitoring rep behavior and ensuring due diligence for another core AI 
            product. </p> <p> My apprenticeship built upon an advanced analytics course with Multiverse, where I mastered data cleaning, 
              data storytelling, and best practices in Power BI, advanced SQL, and Pythonâ€”even building simple LLM models. This data expertise 
              is grounded in a solid full-stack software development foundation from WeCanCodeIT, where I gained proficiency in Java, 
              JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS, and API development. Before my tech career, I refined my sharp attention to detail as a tax expert 
              and honed my skills in teamwork and risk mitigation as an experienced problem solver at Amazon. </p>
